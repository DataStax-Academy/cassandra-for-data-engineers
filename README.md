Have you ever wondered what it takes to design a distributed data processing solution? Some of the main considerations include choosing compute infrastructure, databases, message brokers, message queues, microservices, serverless functions, APIs, and so forth. In this workshop, we focus on choosing and designing a solution architecture from individual components. As a running example and hands-on project, we build a natural language processing system with Cassandra, Pulsar, Keras, TensorFlow, Fast API and Python.
